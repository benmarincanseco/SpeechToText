# Project 4: Speech To Text
-Benjamin Marin
## Design:
For the design I chose to have at most 4 process run with each API call taking up
one process. I chose three since have multiple processes is more intense and three would
be able to run on most devices with at least 4 cores. This means we can handle at most
4 API calls simultaneously
